# Protocol and Example of submission to GenBank

In this session, we will explore how data can be submitted to GenBank using the tools provided by NCBI. 

Sequin is a standalone(offline) tool for sequence submission.

BANKIT is the user-friendly online sequence submission tool that is replacing sequin. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/?tool=genbank

- You can directly upload nucleotide sequence provided by sequencing centres (They may be forward or reverse), OR You can assemble forward and reverse strand into single nucleotide sequence by using codon code software tool. plz visit-www.codoncode.com/
- Before sequence submission, you can ready with all required experimental data or information, i.e. scientific name of source organism, Sequencing method used, primers used, sequences are in FASTA format etc.
-Login to my NCBI account and choose bankit sequence submission tool, a new submission button appears on the screen, click it, follow the steps and to fill required information into the text field provided by the tool, review the submission and finish the sequence submission process.
- If all data or information regarding sequence submission is ready, sequence submission process completed in 10-15 minute )
